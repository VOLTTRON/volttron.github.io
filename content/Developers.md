Eclipse VOLTTRON™ provides an environment where data and devices connect seamlessly and securely to make decisions based on user needs and preferences.  Applications can readily be developed on top of this open source, distributed sensing and control platform for any need that requires collection, management and analysis of data streams. This includes improving energy efficiency in buildings, monitoring the performance of building systems, supporting grid services, coordinating connected homes, managing data and more.

The VOLTTRON™ platform has been developed in Python and makes use of numerous open-source libraries. This includes “base” classes and “helper” utilities that support rapid development and deployment of applications. The goal is to ensure that developers can focus on their algorithms and not worry about interactions with the platform.

**Eclipse VOLTTRON™ Resources**  
The Eclipse VOLTTRON development team supports the wider user community with numerous resources in an effort to maximize transparency and simplify working with the platform. The project is hosted on GitHub for source control, issue tracking, and documentation. Visit Read the Docs <https://eclipse-volttron.readthedoc.io/> for more information.

Office Hours: Stay in touch with our developers by signing up for Eclipse VOLTTRON Office Hours. Meetings occur every other week (Fridays at 11 a.m. PT) and are attended by the development team and members of the user community. There may be select topics, but meetings are intended to provide an open forum for questions ranging from “How do I get started?” to detailed discussions of a specific VOLTTRON™ feature. Join the mailing list to receive links to upcoming events and submit requests to <https://accounts.eclipse.org/mailing-list/volttron-dev/>

**Code Repository**  
Eclipse VOLTTRON holds a large number of repositories in the eclipse-volttron namespace <https://github.com/eclipse-volttron/>.  All of the repositories have a main branch that holds the most stable version of the code and a develop branch which contains the newest code that hasn’t been released yet.

As an open source project, Eclipse VOLTTRON users are encouraged to contribute back to the community. Applications, new services, bug fixes, etc., can all be contributed back to the project through a GitHub pull request. A pull request allows the development team to review the changes and accept them into the codebase.

Eclipse VOLTTRON development is directed by the needs of the community and stakeholders. Feature requests and bug reports should be entered as a Git issue. This notifies the development team and allows others to comment as well.

**Contact Us**</br>
If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to contact the Eclipse VOLTTRON team at <volttron@pnnl.gov>, and the wider community through the resources listed above. We look forward to working with you and are excited by the possibilities this technology can achieve.

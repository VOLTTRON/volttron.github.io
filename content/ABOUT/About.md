Inexpensive, small-scale computers—such as the Raspberry Pi—can have Eclipse VOLTTRON installed as a controller.

### About Eclipse VOLTTRON
Eclipse VOLTTRON, developed at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and available as an open-source tool, provides an environment where data and devices connect seamlessly and securely to make decisions based on user needs and preferences.

Business, research and academic communities agree that Eclipse VOLTTRON is an important and versatile resource for improving building system performance and creating a more flexible and reliable power grid. But the technology’s adaptability has significantly expanded its potential beyond buildings and the grid; users are applying the platform in ways not originally envisioned.

Eclipse VOLTTRON is open source and publicly available from GitHub, and its ongoing development benefits from a highly collaborative approach. The U.S. Department of Energy views the technology as a central component of buildings-grid integration, and provides funding support. Updates and other advances are carried out by a PNNL research team working in concert with an active nationwide community of users.

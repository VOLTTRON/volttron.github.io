### 
Eclipse VOLTTRON software, platform services, and agents are open source and employ a Berkeley Software Distribution-style license, allowing the free distribution and development of the software. The license supports organizations developing proprietary solutions on top of the open-source code.

The platform’s open-source status helps reduce operation, installation, programming and overall integration costs. Further, Eclipse VOLTTRON’s active community of users meets on a regular basis to discuss the technology and contribute improvements and solutions, which helps ensure Eclipse VOLTTRON’s ongoing usefulness and value. Learn more about this aspect of Eclipse VOLTTRON.

A separately licensed platform plugin provides additional capabilities to the platform for large-scale, real-world deployments.

Eclipse VOLTTRON generates powerful outcomes for distributed energy resources (DERs), buildings and the grid! The technology enables effective, secure coordination of DERs, including wind and solar generation and battery storage, with building energy loads and the power system. This offers significant new flexibility to the grid and supports large-scale DER integration, benefitting everyone from building owners and managers to power system operators, utilities, energy services providers and consumers.

With Eclipse VOLTTRON, data, devices and decisions connect seamlessly and securely based on user needs and preferences.

**Eclipse VOLTTRON Overcomes the Obstacles**

Consumers like the concept of using clean, green energy, but it’s estimated that only a small portion of the nation’s power supply comes from wind, solar and other renewable sources. Part of the problem is the intermittent nature of wind and solar, which poses operational challenges for the grid and hinders broader use of renewables. Eclipse VOLTTRON—and buildings—are part of the solution. Eclipse VOLTTRON helps coordinate building energy loads and DER output, lending a hand to grid flexibility and reliability.

**A Force for Coordination**

The Eclipse VOLTTRON software platform and associated applications perform monitoring, data collection and analysis in building and DER systems and devices, producing actionable information that controls and streamlines the integration of clean energy and battery power in building and grid operations.

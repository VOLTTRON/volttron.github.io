 Pacific Northwest National Laboratory has been developing a low-cost central control system for SMBs to more effectively manage heating and cooling, hot water, connected lighting, and potentially other building functions. The system will be interoperable, user-centric, and retrofittable.

**Impact**: Researchers estimate that not only will SMB owners and managers save money and equipment life, but broad deployment of the control system potentially could deliver source energy reductions between 2,000 and 2,500 trillion Btus yearly with commensurate emissions reductions

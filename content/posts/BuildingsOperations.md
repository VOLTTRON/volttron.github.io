 Pacific Northwest National Laboratory has been developing a low-cost central control system for SMBs to more effectively manage heating and cooling, hot water, connected lighting, and potentially other building functions. The system will be interoperable, user-centric, and retrofittable.

**Impact**: Researchers estimate that not only will SMB owners and managers save money and equipment life, but broad deployment of the control system potentially could deliver source energy reductions between 2,000 and 2,500 trillion Btus yearly with commensurate emissions reductions.

Enabling Efficiency in D.C.

Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) partnered with an energy services firm to deploy Eclipse VOLTTRON™—along with applications that improve building operations and efficiency—at a school and office building in Washington, D.C. Read More.

In addition to fault detection and diagnostic technologies that improve efficiency, PNNL also installed and tested its Intelligent Load Control (ILC) in both buildings. ILC quickly and automatically adjusts building electricity needs in response to power grid supply and demand fluctuations.

Impact: Most commercial buildings could benefit from operational improvements and the ability to communicate directly with the power grid to save energy and costs. The application deployments identified some significant energy-saving opportunities for both buildings, as well as infrastructure issues that may hinder effective use. Further, the lessons learned from the testing will help potential future users of ILC and efficiency applications reduce the effort needed to apply the technologies in buildings. 

Dispatching Optimization  and Savings

A Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) technology that employs Eclipse VOLTTRON successfully enabled economic dispatch during a multi-month field test in New York in 2019. Read More.
Economic dispatch effectively optimizes the operation of combined heating, cooling, and power system (CHP) units. This advance could be key in bringing more clean, renewable energy onto the power grid.
PNNL’s method, which also could save energy and enhance grid reliability, successfully enabled economic dispatch during the New York field test at an energy provider’s plant. Results strongly suggest the system can be deployed in the field and customized at lower cost than existing options.

Impact: The technology represents a cost and performance breakthrough, and a step forward in establishing next-generation integrated energy systems. A benchmarking analysis, which examined operations during the field test and compared the economic dispatch system to the previous CHP control method, demonstrated savings on the order of $50 per day. This equates to $20,000 per year in additional profit from a CHP.

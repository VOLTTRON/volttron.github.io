ILC was created as part of the PNNL-led Clean Energy and Transactive Campus project, an effort initially funded by the Department of Energy (DOE) and Washington State. ILC offers three primary buildings-grid capabilities: capacity bidding, which incentivizes targeted consumption reductions; transactive energy methods for enabling a rapid negotiation process between buildings and the grid; and peak power load management.

**Impact**: The technologyâ€™s peak power load management capability has rapidly dropped electricity demand in buildings by 10 to 20 percent, reducing grid stress while maintaining occupant comfort within an acceptable range. ILC has been successfully deployed in multiple buildings at PNNL, at the University of Toledo, in two Washington, D.C. commercial buildings, and will be central to two DOE Connected Communities projects in 2024.

      <description>Eclipse VOLTTRON generates powerful outcomes for distributed energy resources (DERs), buildings and the grid! The technology enables effective, secure coordination of DERs, including wind and solar generation and battery storage, with building energy loads and the power system. This offers significant new flexibility to the grid and supports large-scale DER integration, benefitting everyone from building owners and managers to power system operators, utilities, energy services providers and consumers.&#xA;With Eclipse VOLTTRON, data, devices and decisions connect seamlessly and securely based on user needs and preferences.</description>

      <description>ILC was created as part of the PNNL-led Clean Energy and Transactive Campus project, an effort initially funded by the Department of Energy (DOE) and Washington State. ILC offers three primary buildings-grid capabilities: capacity bidding, which incentivizes targeted consumption reductions; transactive energy methods for enabling a rapid negotiation process between buildings and the grid; and peak power load management.&#xA;Impact: The technology’s peak power load management capability has rapidly dropped electricity demand in buildings by 10 to 20 percent, reducing grid stress while maintaining occupant comfort within an acceptable range.</description>
